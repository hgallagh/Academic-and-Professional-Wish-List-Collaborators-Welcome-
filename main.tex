\maketitle

\section*{Things I've already done that are professionally impressive or gritty to people}

\begin{itemize}

\item[$\boxtimes$] DC optical engineering internship of undersea fiber optic cables

\item[$\boxtimes$] Laser Lab internship while I was in school and walked to the lab in the snow when I didn't have a car

\item[$\boxtimes$] Still study and practice optics during my applied math BS. 

\item[$\boxtimes$] Be a collaborator and 4th author on a LIGO paper...learn advanced optics through that. 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Things I've spitefully done to deal with emotions in a constructive way}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\boxtimes$] Read the monthly aps newspaper the moment it comes in the door\\
\item[$\boxtimes$] Read the monthly Optica and APS magazines to know what is going on in research advances\\
\item[$\boxtimes$] Read an Optica or APS journal article on Terahertz imaging or photonic advances everyday (13 if really upset)
\item[$\boxtimes$] Keep track of the textbooks and conferences I attend and read on goodreads or documents such as this

\end{itemize}

\section*{Things I've done from positive peer pressure}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\square$] Read countless astrophysics whitepapers on the slack channel for ligo since I didn't want any postdocs or optics colleagues to think I was dumb or the dumb attractive stereotype   
\item[$\square$] Meet with professors on campus during a pandemic even though I want to stay healthy from my dad that's immunocompromised now (unaccounted for free labor)
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item[$\boxtimes$] Read the monthly aps newspaper the moment it comes in the door\\

\end{itemize}


\section*{Things I've done that were expected of me}

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\boxtimes$] Read the monthly aps newspaper the moment it comes in the door\\

\end{itemize}


\section*{Tasks I'm counted on to do that I don't mind doing since I signed up for it}
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\square$] RIFT update paper figures
\item[$\square$] Meet with professors on campus during a pandemic even though I want to stay healthy from my dad that's immunocompromised now (unaccounted for free labor)
\end{itemize}




\section*{Tasks}




\section*{Consolation Prizes}


\begin{itemize}
\item[$\square$] Doing project management instead of being a lead scientist aka being put into the bitch role...will bite at the suggestion.
\item[$\square$] Watch other people and "aid" people on doing research aka being put into the bitch role. 
\item[$\square$] Be the girlfriend or wife of a great scientist from being placed into the bitch role and it being labeled love.
\item[$\square$] Test and debug for the senior staff aka the get my coffee bitch role. 
\item[$\square$] Science journalism of interviewing scientists that are more published and distinguished aka the get my coffee bitch role. 
\item[$\square$] Work at a startup instead of a fortune 500 company where you don't get assets
\item[$\square$] Cave early and be forced into an unhappy marriage because you gave up your education and professional goals to keep them in your life then you're forced into debt with kids you don't even want 
\item[$\boxtimes$] Pet sit and garden for people with estates so you can have housing during your internship...and a place alone to study
\item[$\boxtimes$] Walk around with an Optics textbook so you don't have to talk to anyone you don't like longer than 5 minutes since you're busy studying




\end{itemize}


\section*{Wish List and what to work on when someone disrespects my worth and value}


Be a laser scientist fellow at a respected institution in the top 30. 

Have a AAAS fellowship 

Be known as a reputable scientist on the main social media platforms

Write out ideas for this by the end of the month on the weekend. 
Dissertate whether observed or not by an institution by 26 in the field of optics and math modeling (research is astrophysics)...mostly about fiber optics and illumination. 
Not change my mind for these people

Be hot and accomplished since it's sexist brainwash to think being hot is wrong

My family and friends speak to me as if I'm Amber (unaccomplished dumpster fire compartment of personality I will not let them devalue my worth that way through altumatums and their own emotional responses.)

\section*{The pipe and child dreams that most won't support or have and will talk me out of or try to sell me that having kids and a husband is more important or these must be sacrificed for it, but if they happen I would be over the moon with joy and fulfillment...porbably dump or divorce anyone who doesn't support at least a few of these}

Patents on sensors and light tools development type deals

Own or head a national lab \\ 

Nobel prize in physics based on something in the nature of technology development \\

Fields Medal \\ 

Dissertate at various conferences in Tokyo and Japan on Magnetohydrodynamics  \\

Work with NSA and work on clearance projects of a higher caliber and impact \\

Work with Amazon or Google for similar Research and Development projects
